#### Print Without Newline in Python 3.x

Printing without a new line is simple in Python 3. In order to print without newline in Python, you need to add an extra argument to your print function that will tell the program that you don’t want your next string to be on a new line.

Here’s an example:

    print("Hello there!", end = '')
    print("It is a great day.")

The output for our code is:

    Hello there!It is a great day.
